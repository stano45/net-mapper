# net-mapper

net-mapper is a Chrome extension that visualizes the global destinations of your internet traffic. The extension logs the IP addresses of all servers your browser communicates with and displays them on a map, allowing you to see the physical locations of the servers hosting the websites you visit.

## DISCLAIMER
Net Mapper only connects to two external services: OpenStreetMap for map tiles and ip-api.com for geolocation data. All IP addresses logged by the extension are stored exclusively in your local storage and are not transmitted or stored externally, ensuring your browsing data remains private.
